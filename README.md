## Advanced and Mechanical Mates

 ### Description
 This was our second CAD project of the year and it was a bit more complicated than the first. The goal was to make an assembly of four rectangular tubes, connected by a pin, that wpuld telescope together as the pin was moved. 
 
 ### Problems
 The two hardest parts of this project were creating the rectangular tube configurations and mating the final assembly. For the configurations, much of the work was review from last year and from previous CAD assignments. However, I had some difficulty making each configuration a different color. I realized that if I changed the color of one configuration normally then SolidWorks would automatically set all of the other configurations to that same color. I had to go into configuration properties for each individual configuration, select "Use configuration specific color" under Advanced Options, and choose the color I wanted. Mr H showed me how to do this so I didn't have to look anything up but here's a website I found later that outlines the steps in detail: [Configuration Colors How-To](https://www.cati.com/blog/2016/06/solidworks-configuration-specific-color/). Mating the final assembly was also difficult, mostly because it was so complicated. Most of the issues I ran into there were just because I made a few mistakes when reading the Canvas instructions. I just had to make sure that I was reading through things twice and double-checking what I was doing so I didn't accidentally add an incorrect mate.

 ### Lessons Learned
 - Change configuration colors in configuration properties for individual colors
 - READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!! (Especially for complicated assemblies) 
 - Drop parts into assemblies in specific order, it makes everything much easier to organize
