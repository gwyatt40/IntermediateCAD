## Design Tables

  ### Description
  This was the second CAD assignment we had to do this year. We had to use Design Tables to create 7 different configurations of a spool with different sizes and different numbers of holes.

  ### Problems
  The first problem I ran into when building this part was selecting and naming the dimension that coressponded to the number of holes. It took me a while to find it but eventually I realized I had to zoom out in the display. Once I found the dimension I made sure to right-click it (as mentioned in the Canvas instructions) in order to edit the name and not the dimension itself. The next issue I had was with the design table itself. I had made a design table the previous day but had forgotten about it and was confused when SolidWorks didn't let me make a new one. When it turned out that I already had one I just had to figure out how to open it back up and edit it and things went well from there. Clicking between the Canvas instructions page and the SolidWorks window over and over again to check dimensions was a bit tedious, so in the future I would definitely write the dimensions down to save myself some time.

- This is the medium configuration of the spool part. The other configurations are mostly similar with varying sizes and numbers of holes. The exceptions are the small and tiny configurations which don't have central holes. 
  
  ### Lessons Learned
  
- Order your configurations by size in the Design Table, it makes adding in dimensions/supressing components much easier
- If you have to copy someting from Canvas into SolidWorks, write it down or have it open on a seperate computer to save time
- Number dimensions may be hard to find so try zooming out the display window in case they're floating somewhere
- If SolidWorks will not let you create a new Design Table, odds are you already have one and can edit it

## Advanced and Mechanical Mates

 ### Description
 This was our third CAD project of the year and it was a bit more complicated than the first two. The goal was to make an assembly of four rectangular tubes, connected by a pin, that wpuld telescope together as the pin was moved. 
 
 ### Problems
 The two hardest parts of this project were creating the rectangular tube configurations and mating the final assembly. For the configurations, much of the work was review from last year and from previous CAD assignments. However, I had some difficulty making each configuration a different color. I realized that if I changed the color of one configuration normally then SolidWorks would automatically set all of the other configurations to that same color. I had to go into configuration properties for each individual configuration, select "Use configuration specific color" under Advanced Options, and choose the color I wanted. Mr H showed me how to do this so I didn't have to look anything up but here's a website I found later that outlines the steps in detail: [Configuration Colors How-To](https://www.cati.com/blog/2016/06/solidworks-configuration-specific-color/). Mating the final assembly was also difficult, mostly because it was so complicated. Most of the issues I ran into there were just because I made a few mistakes when reading the Canvas instructions. I just had to make sure that I was reading through things twice and double-checking what I was doing so I didn't accidentally add an incorrect mate.

 ### Lessons Learned
 - Change configuration colors in configuration properties for individual colors
 - READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!! (Especially for complicated assemblies) 
 - Drop parts into assemblies in specific order, it makes everything much easier to organize
